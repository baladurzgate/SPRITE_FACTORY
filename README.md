# SPRITE_FACTORY
sprite factory is a bunch of classes and html/css interfaces added to phaser.io to craft sprites , buttons and enemy patterns more quickly . 
For the moment it's based on the file game_data.json where all the entities propeties are written. The editor.html is here to edit this json file 
and preview the change , althougth the code to write the file is not yet written.
